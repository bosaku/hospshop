# This repository was initiated with create-react-native-web-app and was intended as a learning scenario.

Currently, all this application does is allow the user to search a health related thing, and a small repo of terms will be searched and a CPT code provided. 

# The repository was made public on github to become a larger part of a set of tools intended for cracking the problem with hospital price transparency. 

# Development has been moved to an Angular project.  

# A working version can be found [Here](https://hospitalshopp.netlify.app/)
